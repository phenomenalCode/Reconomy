Admin Page:
1. include the logo as it is tn the main Page
2. left hand side should hold vertical menu (not really needed now but the app will likely expand)
3. i think it opens with an employees table in the main content area. At least for now, 
the admin tasks center on the employees.
4. clicking an employee from the table should open a page having to do with the employee.
5. the employee page should have thier company data with a log event table.
6. the log event table should have a date range contol to select log events
7. perhaps the daily hours is calculated in a summary card
8. the average hours could be included in the summary card
9. if summary hour calculations have invalid log event days a flag should be indicated for the admin to resolve
10. an invalid log event date should not be included in the summary calculations.
11. a flagged date in the log event table could create a log event of the missing log event type with a red button
in the timestamp field 
12. the admin can click the red button to popup a  time input and a reason text input.
13. admin inputs the appropriate time and reason then submits the form. the system created log event is then written
to the database and another summary calculation is performed.
